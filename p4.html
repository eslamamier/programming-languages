Thousands of different programming languages were created, mainly in the field of computing Individual software projects commonly use five or more programming languages. Program languages are different from most other forms of human expression because they require a greater degree of accuracy and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous, make small mistakes, and still expect understanding of their intent. In figurative words, however, computers "do just what they're told to do"A programming language offers a standardized framework for identifying data items, and the operations or transformations that can be automatically performed on those data. The abstractions present in language are used by a programmer to describe the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest available elements (called primitives)[67]; Computer programs might be performed without human intervention in a batch process, or a user could type commands in an interpreter's interactive session. In this case the "commands" are simply programs which are chained together to execute. If a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface), it is called a s without compiling.<br>

It is difficult to evaluate which programming language is the most commonly used, because the use meaning varies by context. One language may take up the greater number of programmer hours, another language may have more lines of code, and a third language may consume the most CPU power. Some languages are very <br>



popular for applications of particular kinds. COBOL, for example, remains high in client data c Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages, with implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that their intellectual property is such a proprietary language. Domain-specific programming languages are commonly used<br>
