A programming language is a formal language which includes a set of instructions that produce different output types. The programming languages are used to apply algorithms in computer programming.Most programming languages consist of the computer instructions. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions instead of programming languages generally. Early ones went before th The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax  (form) and semantics  (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C  programming language is specified by an ISO  Standard) while other languages (such as perl) have a dominant  implmentation  that is treated as a reference . Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common. Early Evolutions EditVery early computers, like Colossus, were programmed by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls without the help of a stored programme.Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where each instruction is written by the programmer in a numerical form that the hardware can directly execute. The instruction to add the value into two, for exampleAnother early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype  The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959  FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time. Thousands of different programming <br>


languages were created, mainly in the field of computing.] Individual software projects commonly use five or more programming languages.Program languages are different from most other forms of human expression because they require a greater degree of accuracy and completeness. Humans authors use a natural language to communicate with others<br>
