  <th>The programming languages are the formal built languages designed to communicate the instructions to the machine, particularly to the computer, and they can be used to build programs to monitor the machine 's actions or to express algorithms.Language programming is very productive for the program, programming is really amazing if you understand it, you can get the money. <br>
  The programming codes are the instructions used to tell the computer what to do, most programming languages are relatively easy to learn and use, you can make beautiful websites, all websites and applications started with a little code and then progressed over time, and they can make you rich The programming languages allow for simple creation and editing in the variety of text editors, they help you to add dynamic and interactive activities to the web pages, you can edit and run the code very quickly, you will be better at coding / programming over time, they help you to perform the complex tasks in relatively few steps and they require minimum programming or experience.<br>
OOP Speeches (ObThe programming languages differ from the natural languages in that the natural languages are used only for people to interact, while the programming languages allow people to communicate the instructions to the machines. C language is the building block for many other languages that are currently recognized. It has a variety of data types and powerful operatorsFortran is the number-crunching program, it is mostly used by scientists because it allows variables of any size up to the machine's memory limit, it is not nearly as versatile as C or C++, and the programming is static. Java is the multi-platform language that is useful in networking, the most common use of Java is on the web, it is used to build cross-platform programs that function. </th>
    <th>The bugs can get annoying and sometimes they're hard to solve. If you're not good at math then programming won't be easy, a lot of thinking involved, if you don't have a good memory, then it's hard to memorize the programming language syntaxIf you type the programming slowly, it will take you a lot of time to program it, you can type loads of code in seconds because you know the syntax, but it takes thought and reasoning.C Language has no concept of OOPs, that's why C++ is developed, there's no run time checking in C language, there's no strict type checking, you can pass an integer value, it's used for the floating data type, it doesn't have the namespace concept, it doesn't have the builder or destructor concept.<br>
Object-Oriented Languages must be well managed, the class-specialized functions can access the Instance (or shared class) variables of an object, they are not as effective on simple programs. <br>
Procedural Languages are difficult to apply code from one program to another, Modifying one part of the code requires modification of the entire code, As the code grows, it becomes more difficult to understand and modify, functional Languages can not do IO, they can not interact with the outside world, and no first line of code guarantee will be executed before the second line.
